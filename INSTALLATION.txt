///////////////////////
//  Can I add map, mod or server-specific overrides for certain settings?

Yes !
You can use blck_custom_config.sqf to code any overrides you like. An example for changing some settings for Namalsk is provided.

// What is this blck_debugON variable about?
It turns on accelerated mission spawning by default and activated additional logging.
You can turn it on or of in custom_server\Compiles\blck_variables.sqf.
Be careful about what you change in this file. 

///////////////////////////////////////////
// Further customization

Just about anything about the missions can be modified. The mission template (see Missions\Orange\supply_camp.sqf and Missions\Blue\default.sqf for examples) allow you to define mission specific parameters.
To create a new mission, make a copy of a mission template (e.g., custom_server\Blue\default.sqf). Edit the parameters to your liking and rename to file appropriately.
Add the file name (e.g., "newmissions.sqf") the the mission list found in custom_server\Missions. 
That mission will now be spawned whenever it is selected from teh list.

Items you can edit include includes:
the objects that are spawned,
The vehicles AI patrol in,
The loot added to loot chests, which can either be that defined in the default configurations or something custom for that particular loot container or mission,
The objects that are spawned with the AI, which could be a few objects as is the case with the default missions or an entire base,
Whether the objects are spawned in a precise ordered way or randomly (see the Missions\Blue\default.sqf for an example of randomly spawned objects),
The difficulty of the mission,

Settings for the mission system as a whole, and default values for most variables, are found in the mod-specific config (blck_configs_epoch.sqf or blck_configs_exile.sqf).

You can set whether:

whether vehicles are spawned as loot and whether they have anything inside them,
whether mines are spawned (better not have these if you have vehicle patrols),
whether players get to keep the AI patrol vehicles,
whether smoke is present to indicate the location of the mission,
whether players are penalized for running over AI or killing them with certain vehicle guns,
whether map markers are centered over the mission or not
