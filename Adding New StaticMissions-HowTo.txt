This update includes an 3DEN plugin to make it easy to export static missions.
This can be done by laying out everything for your static mission in the 3DEN editor, 
then using the @blckeagls_3DEN editor plugin.

My approach to doing this as follows:

1) Start Arma with the following mods: 
	@epoch;@exile;@blckeagls_3DEN.
	(adjust to meet your specific needs; obviously any additional mods such as those from CUP can be included).

2) Start the Eden Editor.
3) Lay out your static mission. You should:
	place a marker indicating where it will spawn (save your work)
	Set the icon/shape, color and any text for your marker 

	Place all buldings, sandbags, etc (save your work)
	Place any vehicle or air patrols - 
		Note that they will patrol using the postion at which you place them as the centerpoint of their patrol.
	(save your work).
	Place any static weapons.
		Note: these can be inside or on top of buildings.

	(save your work).
	Place a unit at each location you wish to have a group patrol.
		Note: The mission spawner will attempt to spawn an entire group at these locations using the weapons, uniforms, 
		etc defined in blck_config.sqf or its derivatives.
		Note: groups can be spawned inside or on top of buildings; just place on unit whereever you want a groupl

	Place some sort of ammo box, cardboard box, or other loot container. 
	Save your work.
	
	Note the postion of your marker.

	Set Difficulty level as desired using the dropdown menu at the right of the toolbar.
	
	Select Export Static Mission from the blckeagls dropdown menu.
	Select Copy, then paste the text into a text editor.
	Change any settings including numbers of AI, AI respawn times, or patrol radii.

	Save the file to the custom_server\Missions\Static\missions directory then
	add filename for your new static mission to custom_server\Missions\Static\GMS_StaticMissionLists.sqf
	
in order to specify additional options. Use the information provided in the example static missions to guide you.
